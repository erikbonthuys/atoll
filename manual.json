The radio wave imparts magnetism to the ferrite core which in turn induces a current in each coil which depends on the direction of the magnetic field or the direction of the incoming radio wave.  The induced currents in the coils are transmitted to two starter coils of a goniometer where the magnetic field detected by the loop will be recreated.  If the rotor or search coil is turned through 360\u00b0 there will be two maximum and two null positions exactly as in the rotating loop (a figure of eight polar diagram).  The output from a sense aerial is combined with the figure of eight polar diagram to give a cardioid.

The function of the iso-echo display is to:  a)   Cause a hole to appear in the cloud where precipitation is heavy. b)   Increase the reflections of areas experiencing heavy rain. c)   Display areas of heavy precipitation in red.  6.    Distortion due to the effect of pulse length causes:  a)   Two targets to appear as a single one. b)   The PPI image to extend in range by one half of the pulse length. c)   The range of the target to increase by one half the pulse length.  7.    The beamwidth of an ASR is 5\u00b0 wide. When tilted up by 3.5\u00b0 the top  of a Cb cloud at a 50 nm range just disappears. Determine the height of the top of the cloud above the aircraft's level.  a)  1266 ft b)  1773 ft c)  5067 ft  8.    The conical pencil beam gives a greater range than the cosecant    beam:  a)   True b)   False c)   The range is the same as the power range available to both is  the same. ",

A GPS receiver identifies individual satellites by their :  (a)  group repetition interval, (b)  unique Coarse Acquisition (C/A) code, (c)  unique frequency.  3.  GPS receivers require corrections for three major types of timing errors between transmission and reception of the signal. They are :-  (a)  relativistic time delay, ionospheric and tropospheric distortions, (b)  relativistic time delay, earth's magnetic field and ionospheric distortions, (c)  earth's magnetic field, ionospheric and tropospheric distortions.  4.  A major error of GPS is the relativistic time delay, which is caused by :-  (a)  the difficulty in synchronizing the receiver quartz clock with the satellite atomic clock, (b)  the elliptical orbit of the satellite passing through different gravitational fields affecting the time kept by the atomic clock, (c)  errors of the receiver clock or oscillator.  5.  The timing error due to tropospheric distortion of GPS signals is maximum when the receiver is  (a)  at high altitude and the elevation angle of the satellite is high, (b)  at low altitude and the elevation angle of the satellite is high, (c)  at low altitude and the elevation angle of the satellite is low.  6.  The GPS Control Segment :-  (a)  selects  the  four  best  satellites  to  use  for  navigation  with  respect  to  their geometry and altitude, (b)  calculates and controls the clock bias error of the aeroplanes receiver, (c)  accurately tracks the GPS satellites and provides them with periodic updates correcting their ephemeris co-ordinates and their clock bias factors.

The frequency at which radio signals begin to penetrate the ionosphere and escape into space is called the maximum usable frequency (MUF), therefore it is undesirable to use the higher frequency portion of the radio spectrum (3 \u2013 30 MHz) for night long range communications because:  a)  during periods of low sunspot activity the MUF can drop to as low as 5 MHz;  b)  the ionosphere penetration is greater at the higher frequencies causing signal distortion and atmospheric interference;  c)  broadcast stations operating at high power cause serious interference.  2.  The Very High Frequency band is:  a)  300 \u2013 3 000 MHz; b)  30 \u2013 300 MHz; c)  300 \u2013 3 000 KHz. (1)  3.
